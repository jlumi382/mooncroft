You need to download forge 1.19.2 first which is in the repository. Just open the file `"forge-1.19.2-43.4.0-installer.jar"`.
When downloading forge in your legacy launcher, make sure to set your minecraft directory to `"C:\Users\lumi\AppData\Roaming\.tlauncher\legacy\Minecraft\game"`.
After the installation, run `"1.19.2-forge-43.4.0"` in your minecraft launcher then exit out.

# Installation
Go to the `mods` directory in the repository then copy and paste all the contents to `"C:\Users\lumi\AppData\Roaming\.tlauncher\legacy\Minecraft\game\home\1.19.2-forge-43.4.0\mods\"`.

You can paste the contents of the `Optional (Client Side)` directory to enable some of the optional mods.
